# ⚔️ Elden Ring Weapon Analysis (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard analyzing weapon data from *Elden Ring*. The goal is to help players understand weapon performance across damage types, stat scaling, weight, and build compatibility. It uses real game data to create interactive visuals for smarter decision-making during gameplay.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
With over 300 weapons in *Elden Ring*, players often struggle to choose the most effective weapon for their builds. The complexity of stat requirements, scaling, and hybrid damage types makes it hard to optimize choices without structured analysis.

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Analyze total damage output across all weapons
- Breakdown by damage types (Physical, Magic, Fire, etc.)
- Stat requirement and scaling impact analysis
- Weapon weight vs damage trade-off
- Highlight top weapons by performance
- Match weapons to popular build types (STR, DEX, INT, FTH, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Key KPIs
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Weapons | 324 |
| Max Total Damage | 672 |
| Average Weapon Weight | 7.12 |
| Most Common Scaling Stat | Strength |
| Most Common Damage Type | Physical |
